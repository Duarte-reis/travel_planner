🔎 Project overview

**Travel Planner** is a centralized application for travel agencies to streamline workflows and manage data efficiently.  Automates budgets, organizes itineraries, and generates client-ready proposals, enabling agencies to deliver accurate and high-quality travel experiences. 

## 🚨 What problems does Travel Planner solve?

Travel agencies, especially those managing group travel, still rely on manual, fragmented tools like Excel and Word.

This lack of a centralized system leads to inefficiencies, higher error risk, and significant time spent on repetitive administrative tasks, reducing team productivity.

As a result, valuable time is taken away from trip personalization and client relationships, while operational delays and inconsistencies negatively impact the customer experience and trust.

## 🙏 Solution

Travel Planner is an all-in-one platform that simplifies group travel planning by replacing fragmented tools with a single, integrated system. It automates budget creation, centralizes itinerary management, and generates professional, client-ready proposals.

By consolidating all data in one place, teams no longer need to switch between spreadsheets or multiple documents, reducing manual work, errors, and inconsistencies.

Repetitive processes that once took hours become faster and easier to manage, allowing teams to maintain better control over costs, margins, and the content presented to clients.
